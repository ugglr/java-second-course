Aim

Constructing program components which are easy to change, reusable and resource-aware requires good knowledge of advanced language constructs and programming techniques as well as data abstraction, data structures and algorithms. The aim of the course is to give students increased knowledge of object oriented programming techniques and a selection of fundamental algorithms and data structures and to give them the ability to understand and use APIs for classical data structures and algorithms in modern object oriented program libraries.

Learning outcomes

Knowledge and understanding
For a passing grade the student must

be able to define and explain important object oriented concepts and techniques in addition to what has been covered in the first programming course
be able to describe common abstract data types and their applications
be familiar with existing library classes for common abstract data structures and algorithms
Competences and skills
For a passing grade the student must

* be able to apply advanced object oriented concepts and techniques and advanced language constructs in Java in her/his own programming
* be able to use frameworks for graphical user interfaces in Java
* be able to use modern object oriented standard libraries
* be able to identify appropriate algorithms and data types for solving a given problem
* be able to implement fundamental abstract data types and algorithms in an object oriented language
* be able to formulate and implement recursive algorithms
* be able to apply simple techniques for analysing the time complexity of algorithms
* Judgement and approach

For a passing grade the student must
* be able to construct programs which are easy to understand and to modify
* be able to evaluate proposed solutions and data representations for given problems with respect to usability and efficiency
  Contents

Object oriented concepts and language constructs such as interface, inner classes, exceptions and generics. Important general interfaces such as Iterator, ListIterator, Comparable and Comparator. Overview of graphical interfaces. Recursion as a technique to construct and implement algorithms. Common abstract data types: Set, Queue, Stack, List and Dictionary and their corresponding classes in the Java API.
